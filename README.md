# Project-06-Ham-Spam-Classification

This project is a web application designed to detect whether a given message is spam or not. It leverages machine learning techniques to classify messages as either spam or ham (non-spam).

## Features
- **Multiple Models**: Utilizes various machine learning models to improve accuracy and performance.
- **Vectorization**: Employs vectorizers such as TF-IDF to convert text data into numerical format.
- **Data Cleaning and Transformation**: Includes comprehensive data cleaning and transformation steps to ensure high-quality input for the models.

## Models and Techniques

- **Vectorization**: TF-IDF Vectorizer
- **Models**: LogisticRegression, SVC, DecisionTreeClassifier, MultinomialNB, KNeighborsClassifier, RandomForestClassifier, AdaBoostClassifier, BaggingClassifier, ExtraTreesClassifier, GradientBoostingClassifier, XGBClassifier
- **Data Processing**: Tokenization, stop word removal, and text normalization
